# Biodiversity-in-National-Parks
Trying my hand at Data Science.
For this project, I interpreted data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.
Performed some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, I analyzed, cleaned up, and plotted data as well as posed questions and seeked to answer them in a meaningful way.
